#### Primary Menu

Primary navigation menu, named `Primary`, is displayed at the top of every page. Submenu items are automatically hidden until users hover over the parent menu item. They are permanently hidden on mobile, see [Child Page Menus](#child-page-menus).

#### Footer Menu

Footer menus are `sitemap` and `Downloadable Content`. The sitemap is a complete list of all pages on our website (posts are NOT included). Downloadable Content contains custom links to external content.

#### Parent and Child Menus

Child pages are pages that have had their parent set in `Page Attributes`.

You can see an overview of which pages are treated as parents and which are children in your websites admin area (select `Pages`)

Any page prepended with `-` is a child of the above parent. When viewing any child page, an additional navigation menu containing the parent all it's children is diplayed just below the page heading.
